      "  Optymize allows users to stake their tokens to earn return in the form of OPZ (Optimizable Z tokens) plus an opportunity to earn common ownership rewards via gOPZ. This means the number of Optymize Vaults that can be created is limited by capital and user stake rates to ensure the network remains sustainable.\n",

      "  Deposit by staking your tokens into the Optymize Vault, bearing the risk of a Security Incident. Each token can be deposited for the purpose of earning both Opz revenues and tiered APY rewards related to liquidity pool activities on the exchange.\n",

      "  Optymize tokenomics involves selecting tokens to be pooled together based on various factors like TVL, risk, audit scores, market demand, and community feedback. The tokens can be staked to earn APY, and from there investors can indirectly contribute to the profitability of the protocol.\n",

It shares losses proportionally among all depositors when a Security Incident happens, and uses an intelligent algorithm to manage risks while sharing token prices proportionally among all depositors.\n",
